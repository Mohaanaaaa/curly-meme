To keep your project clean, ensure your templates are organized as follows:

templates/shop/login.html: The new login form.

templates/shop/registration_success.html: The page where they first see their ID and QR.

templates/shop/dashboard.html: Updated to show the shop_name from the session.

templates/shop/home.html: Updated to show statistics for that specific shop_id only.
